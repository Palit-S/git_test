## 1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes to their codebase over time. It allows you to create and manage different versions of your project, making it easier to collaborate with others, revert to previous states, and keep your codebase organized.

## 2. What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, as well as additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaborative tools. GitHub is widely used by developers and teams for open-source projects, personal projects, and enterprise-level development.

## 3. Key Concepts
- **Repositories**: A repository, or "repo" for short, is a collection of files and folders that make up a project. It holds the complete history of changes made to the project.
- **Commits**: A commit represents a specific set of changes made to the repository at a given point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes a commit message that describes the changes.
- **Branches**: Branches allow you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. You can create new branches to develop features or experiment without affecting the main codebase.
- **Pull Requests**: A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows collaborators to review and discuss the changes before merging them into the main codebase.
- **Forks and Clones**: Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account. Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of the repository on your machine, which you can work on and synchronize with the remote repository.

## 4. Getting Started
To begin using Git and GitHub:
1. Install Git: Download and install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com). Follow the instructions for your operating system.
2. Create a GitHub Account: Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com.
3. Configure Git: Set up your Git username and email address using the following commands in your terminal:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
   ```
   
## 5. Basic Git Workflow
The basic Git workflow involves the following steps:
1. Initialize a Repository: Create a new Git repository or initialize an existing project folder as a Git repository using the command `git init`.
2. Stage Changes: Use the command `git add` to stage changes. You can specify individual files or use `git add .` to stage all changes.
3. Commit Changes: Create a commit with the staged changes using the command `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
4. View History: Use `git log` to view the commit history and `git diff` to see the changes made in a specific commit.
5. Branching: Create and switch to a new branch using `git branch branch-name` and `git checkout branch-name`, respectively.
6. Merging: Merge changes from one branch into another using `git merge branch-name`.
7. Pushing and Pulling: Push your local commits to a remote repository using `git push` and update your local repository with changes from the remote using `git pull`.

## 6. Collaborating on GitHub
To collaborate on GitHub:
1. Fork a Repository: On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to contribute to and click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
2. Clone the Fork: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <forked-repo-url>`.
3. Make Changes and Commit: Make your desired changes, stage them with `git add`, and commit them with `git commit`.
4. Push Changes: Push your local commits to your forked repository using `git push`.
5. Create a Pull Request: On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository and click the "New pull request" button. Describe your changes and submit the pull request for review.

## 7. Useful Resources
